# What is needed to graduate from an Open Seeds - OLS cohort?

## These are the requirements to be able to graduate from the Open Seed programme by Open Life Science:

1. Attend at least 5 mentor-mentee meetings, unless there is a valid reason that your mentor(s) can attest to. (The Open Seeds program includes 8 mentor-mentee meetings in total.) 
2. A “yes” from your mentor(s) confirming your participation and engagement with the Open Seeds curriculum. 
  * What should a mentor consider? The mentor(s) should analyse if the mentee(s) have or have not made consistent efforts to advance their projects, and showed interest in the topic of open science and willingness to advance the goals of open science in their work.
  * Note that this does not mean that participants have to complete their project, or execute it as planned. It’s fine to change directions, or even decide the project isn’t needed to continue - so long as genuine thought went into it. 
3. Open Canvas discussed with their mentor. 
4. Vision and Mission statements discussed with their mentor. 
5. Roadmap discussed with their mentor. 
6. Attend cohort calls, or watch recorded videos, and contribute to the shared notes (etherpads) from cohort calls.
7. Participate in at least one skill up session, co-working/cafeteria/q&a session. 
8. Complete the mid-term survey for project leads/mentees. 
9. Presente a 5-minute presentation in one of the graduation calls. 
 
## What we expect from you at the graduation

1. You will have 5 minutes to present your work. Please discuss your plan with your team and mentor in the meeting before graduation, prepare your presentation and be ready to answer questions from fellow participants.  
2. We want to hear about your project, the progress you have made, the hurdles you encountered, and what comes next. If you want, use the chance to invite others to join you as collaborators or advisers. 
3. If possible, please use the OLS template and Open Seeds and OLS logos in your presentation https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1575V9FZXgQA5DXkGRKYiRHbdR5D_QZWWFdwpYST6NWI/edit#slide=id.g21280744133_2_2 
4. If it is a group project, we would prefer if all project members are present during the graduation call, and more than one person speaks/delivers the presentation.
5. Please upload your presentation on Zenodo, and include 'openlifesci' in the 'community' section. This will allow us to feature your presentation on our Zenodo community page. 

### Reminder 

Do remember to sign up for and attend one of the graduation rehearsals, so you can get feedback and ideas for your presentation. For OLS-7, check the times here: https://openlifesci.org/ols-7/schedule/ 

### Graduates and their projects 

Upon graduation, as a OLS-7 cohort graduate you can call yourself an OLS Fellow and Alumna/Alumni.

We have recently named our mentoring programme as Open Seeds. You can refer to the graduating projects as Open Seeds Sprout or seedlings, or Open Seeds Plántula or Germoglio… etc (see below).

In Portuguese: “broto”, a young plant = muda or mudinha
In Spanish: “plántula”
In French: 
In Italian: Germoglio
In Russian: Проросток
In Hebrew: 
In German: Spross
(add)

### What happens if you can’t attend any ceremony but want to graduate? 

You can record your presentation and we can play it during one of the graduation ceremonies.

### What happens if you do not graduate? 

- Those who don’t graduate, can they say they participated? You can say you participated, but didn't not complete it. 
- Can you apply again to OLS? Yes, you can apply again with another different project. 
- Can you come back to OLS, in the next cohort with the same project? You can. Please describe in your proposal what challenges or hurdles blocked you from continuing your participation in the previous cohort. We also ask your mentor what they think and if they recommend any changes. 

## Extension for anyone affected by special circumstances. 

- If you would like to schedule a separate graduation call for any reasons (like affected by COVID-19 situation in your family/country/community or a big life event at home/work/personal reasons that impacted your work and slowed down your OLS project), please contact the OLS team by emailing [team@openlifesci.org](mailto:team@openlifesci.org).

## Other Q&As 

- If you didn’t graduate, can you be nominated by your mentor to become a mentor? 
  - Some of our participants are open science practitioners and experts, and hence can be nominated as a mentor. We would prefer that you graduate from the programme unless there is a valid reason you or your mentor can share with the OLS team.
- Can people nominate themselves to be invited back as experts, facilitators or mentors? 
  - Graduates can nominate themselves as experts and facilitators. They can express their interest to join as mentors, but we will confirm your readiness to mentor from your mentor. 
- Can people be nominated by other OLS community members despite not having graduated? 
  - Yes, but we will prioritise graduates in the next cohort to ensure that fair opportunity is given to folks who have engaged in the programme.
